# Morrowind_Fullscreen
Allow to run Morrowind in fullscreen on Windows 10.  
On Windows 10, running Morrowind in fullscreen mode will show a window border and a part of the window won't be visible as it is out of the screen bounds.  
This little program will remove the Morrowind window border and put the window in fullscreen mode.

## Compilation
Use Cygwin to compile the program.  
This is a console program, so you can run it from the Cygwin console.  
The program has been tested on Windows 10 Professionnal N 64-bit.
Run Cygwin or the program in administrator mode if you get the error 5 (Access Denied).

## Usage
Start the program before launching Morrowind.  
When Morrowind is detected, the program will put it in fullscreen and exit.
